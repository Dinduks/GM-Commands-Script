This script allows you to execute GM commands on your MaNGOS server without logging into the game, only from a command line. 

How to: 
- Enable PHP's SOAP extension (extension=php_soap.dll in php.ini)
- Specify you username, password and the server's IP in the script itself
  The username and the password are the ones that you use to log into your GM account
- Open a command prompt, cd /the/scripts/dir/, and execute commands this way: php gm.php character level Dinduks 70
  Make sure you have php in your path
